# We are using https://standardjs.com coding style. It is unfortunately incompatible with Prettier;
# see https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/996 and the linked issues.
# Standard does not handle Markdown files though, so we want to use Prettier formatting.
# The goal of the configuration below is to configure Prettier to lint only Markdown files.
